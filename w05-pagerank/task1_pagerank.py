"""Week 5 · Task 1 — PageRank, and the two ways it breaks.

Textbook §5.1 (PageRank), §5.1.3 (dead ends), §5.1.4 (spider traps).

PageRank is a random surfer following links forever, and the rank of a page is
how often the surfer is there. As one line of linear algebra it is
`r = M r`, and as written it does not work on the actual web.

Two structures break it, and the fix for both is the same one line. Build the
broken version first so you can see each failure, then fix it.

      dead ends    a node with no out-links. Where does its rank go, and where
                   should it go instead?
      spider traps a group of nodes that only link to each other. Without
                   teleporting, they end up with all of it

    Stop early when the ranks stop moving - `tol` is the L1 change below which
    you should call it converged. Return the ranks, and set `pagerank.iterations`
    to how many you actually used, because Task 2 measures that.
